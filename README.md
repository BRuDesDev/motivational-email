# Motivational Email ðŸ“§
A program written in Python that sends an email once a week, containing a random motivational quote.  Uses datetime, random, and smtplib modules.


# Download and Setup
>$ git clone https://github.com/BRuDesDev/motivational-email.git
>
>$ cd motivational-email

# Open main.py to edit variables to make work for you
>$ sudo nano main.py

# Fill in the constants with correct info
MY_EMAIL = "your email to send from"

MY_PASSWORD = "password to login to your above email"

RECIPIENT_EMAIL = "email to send to"

EMAIL_SMTP = "the smtp host server for your email"  # yahoo = "smtp.mail.yahoo.com" | gmail = "smtp.gmail.com | hotmail = smtp.live.com | If using other provider, google to find smtp server

DAY_TO_SEND = "the day you want email to send. Monday=0, Tuesday=1...Sunday=6"

# Once you have filled in the variables to work properly, just run:
>$ python3 main.py

# With scripts like these... 
to simply run it in our terminal is not logical. If we want this script to send us an email every week, we need this script to run on a server, or using a service like pythonanywhere.com that will run as a task whatever day/time we set.
